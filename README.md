# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of Project
**Background**
This project is to repeat the school district analysis to examine how replacing math and reading scores with **NaNs** affected the overall analysis in an effort to help Maria reveal any **evidence of academic dishonesty** in reading and math grades for Thomas High school ninth graders.

### Purpose
**Goal**
To repeat analysis on students_complete.csv file in ordert to show the extent of academic dishonesty so that state-testing standards can be upheld

**Approach/Method**
To select the ninth-grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School using the Pandas **loc** method with conditional statements and comparison and logical operators. I then used the Pandas Numpy module to change the reading and math scores to NaN

**Results**
How is the district summary affected?
